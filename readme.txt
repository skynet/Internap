== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Use your favorite FTP program to change permissions to the cache directory. More information about CHMOD and how to make files writable is available at the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions). Making the plugin or your whole blog directory writable is NOT recommended anymore due to security reasons.
3. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
4. Open the plugin configuration page, which is located under Plugins -> Internap and insert credentials. You need to have an account with Internap, for this step.
5. The features this plugin offers will be available under Media -> Internap
